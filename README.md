## Fruit AI

Fruit AI is an advanced machine learning project designed to classify and identify different types of fruits from images. Utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning models, this project demonstrates how AI can be applied to real-world scenarios such as image classification and object recognition.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Classify images of fruits into various categories.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieve high accuracy using advanced deep learning models.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive and easy-to-use interface for uploading and classifying fruit images.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for implementing the machine learning models.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Frameworks for building and training deep learning models.
- **OpenCV**: Library for image processing tasks.
- **Flask**: Web framework for serving the machine learning model via an API.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For the web interface.

## Installation

To get started with Fruit AI, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pridhigupta/Fruit-ai.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd Fruit-ai
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Run the Flask Application**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

1. Open the web interface in your browser.
2. Upload an image of a fruit.
3. The model will classify the fruit and display the result.
